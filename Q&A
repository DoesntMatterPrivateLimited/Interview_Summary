17. what is Security group?
ans= A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your AWS resources to control inbound and outbound traffic.

18. what is Network ACL?
ans= A network ACL (Access Control List) is a stateless firewall at the subnet level that controls inbound and outbound traffic in a VPC using rules.

19. what is Peering connection?
ans= A peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that allows them to communicate privately using internal IP addresses.

20. what is Transit gateways?
ans= An AWS Transit Gateway is a central hub that connects multiple VPCs, on-premises networks, and remote networks, simplifying network management.

21. what is DHCP?
ans= DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses and other network configuration information to devices on a network.

22. what is Cloud Watch?
ans= Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that provides real-time insights into AWS resources, applications, and system performance.

23. what is IAM?
ans= AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a service that enables you to securely manage access to AWS resources by defining users, groups, and permissions.

24. what is EC2?
ans= Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a scalable compute service that allows you to run virtual servers in the cloud.

25. what is kubernetes?
ans= Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

26. what is taint and toleration?
ans= Taints and tolerations in Kubernetes work together to ensure that pods are only scheduled on appropriate nodes by preventing pods from being scheduled on tainted nodes unless they tolerate the taint.

27. what is pod?
ans= A Pod in Kubernetes is the smallest deployable unit that represents a single instance of a running process in a cluster, encapsulating one or more containers with shared storage and network.

28. Difference between EC2 and ECR?
ans= EC2 is a virtual server to run applications, while ECR is a container image registry to store and manage Docker images.

29. Difference between Docker and Kubernetes?
ans= Docker is a tool for creating and running containers, while Kubernetes is a platform for orchestrating and managing multiple containers across clusters.

30. Difference between continues integration and continues delivery and continues deployment?
ans= Continuous Integration automatically builds and tests code on every change,
     Continuous Delivery ensures code is always ready to deploy,
     Continuous Deployment automatically deploys every change to production without manual approval.

31. Why we are used Terraform and what was the purpose?
ans= We use Terraform to automate the provisioning and management of cloud infrastructure using code.
     The purpose of Terraform is to enable Infrastructure as Code (IaC), allowing teams to provision, manage, and version cloud infrastructure reliably and efficiently across multiple providers.

32. What is the used of Docker file?
ans= A Dockerfile is used to define the instructions for building a Docker image, including the app, dependencies, and environment setup.

33. what is the used of load balance and how it help up in application scalibility?
ans= A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers, helping improve application scalability by ensuring no single server is overwhelmed.

34. what is autoscaling?
ans= Autoscaling automatically adjusts the number of running instances based on demand to ensure performance and cost efficiency.

35. what are the types of scaling?
ans= The main types of scaling are vertical scaling (adding more resources to a single machine) and horizontal scaling (adding more machines to handle increased load).

36. what are the component in kubrnetes?
ans= The main components of Kubernetes are:
    Master components: API Server, Controller Manager, Scheduler, etcd (cluster state store)
    Node components: Kubelet, Kube-proxy, Container runtime (e.g., Docker, containerd)

ans= A ReplicaSet in Kubernetes ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.

38. what is Deployment?
ans= A Deployment in Kubernetes manages ReplicaSets and provides declarative updates for Pods to ensure the desired application state.

39. what is Blue & Green Deployment?
ans= Blue Deployment: The current live environment serving production traffic.
     Green Deployment: The new version deployed in a separate environment, tested and made live by switching traffic from blue.

40. what is Rollout & Rollback?
ans= Rollout: The process of deploying a new version of an application or update to production.
     Rollback: The process of reverting to a previous stable version after a failed deployment or issue.

41. what is ConfigMap in k8s?
ans= In Kubernetes, a ConfigMap is an object that allows you to store configuration data as key-value pairs and inject it into pods as
